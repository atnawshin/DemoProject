		<b>Friends</b> is one of those TV shows that has become strangely timeless, despite its very obvious ’90s and early 2000s trappings. The show ran from <u>1994 to 2004</u>, but it’s long been a staple in local and cable syndication, and when it arrived on <mark style="color: #7F4E52; background-color: #C48793">Netflix in 2015</mark>, it found a whole new generation of fans, for whom the adventures of six attractive New Yorkers who could afford massive apartments while rarely seeming to work all that hard took on an even greater air of aspirational fantasy than the show had from the start.

		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing"> Chandler Muriel Bing </a> is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by actor Matthew Perry. Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. He is of Scottish and Swedish descent.[citation needed] He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family.[citation needed] Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood and develop his notorious sense of humour as a defense mechanism. It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.
		Chandler's best friend is Joey Tribbiani, who is his roommate. He previously lived with his good friend Ross Geller. He met Ross' sister, Monica Geller, and her friend, Rachel Green, while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross' love for Rachel.[citation needed] He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay. Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a defense mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a child. He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account of responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a young age.[citation needed] He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, he and Monica go on to adopt twins. </p>

His relationship with Rachel Green was included in TV Guide's list of the best TV couples of all time, as well as Entertainment Weekly's "30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples". Kevin Bright, one of the executive producers of the show, had worked with Schwimmer before, so the writers were already developing Ross's character in Schwimmer's voice; hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show.
